Welcome to Terradue ${project.name}!!

  Terradue ${project.name} is a set of command line tools to interact with DSI REST APIs for enabling the creation of
  public clouds managed by OpenNebula.

  ${project.name} is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed. Users need at least the
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Java Development Kit (JDK) is a plus.

Installation

  [[1]] Download the <<<${project.build.finalName}.tar.gz>>> distribution archive to the
        <<<OPEN_NEBULA_HOME/src/cloud>>> directory.

  [[2]] Add ${project.name} to your path, e.g.

+---+
export PATH=OPEN_NEBULA_HOME/src/cloud/${project.build.finalName}/bin:$PATH
+---+

  [[3]] Make sure that <<<JAVA_HOME>>> is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. <<<export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_29>>>
        and that <<<$JAVA_HOME/bin>>> is in your <<<PATH>>> environment variable.
